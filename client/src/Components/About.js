                    <p>I am originally from Abilene, Texas where I obtained a Bachelors Degree in Electronic Media from Abilene Christian University. I enlisted in the Active Duty Air Force in 2011 as a Cryptologic Language Analyst and was assigned to various inteligence squadrons from 2011-2017. During this time I was selected to attend Officer Training School (OTS) and received a commission as a second lieutenant in 2018. I am married and have 2 children (Son - 11, Daughter - 9).</p>
                    <p>In my current job, I serve as a Cybersecutiy operations integrator. In this role I manage a 12 member team to interface between the Air Force cyber operations community and Air Force IT contractors ensuring that vendor network infrastructure and devices conform to Air Force cybersecurity requirements.  </p>
                    <p>In my previous job I conducted cybersecurity analysis in support of operational testing of Air Force and Space Force acquisition programs. In this role, I planned and analyzed tests to measure the effects of cyber attack on weapon systems. I coordinated closely with blue and red cyber teams to create a comprehensive characterization of the cybersecurity status of a system, identify vulnerabilities, inform reconnaissance activities in support of adversarial testing, exploit system vulnerabilities, cause potential impact to mission operations, identify mitigation techniques, and evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to support its mission while withstanding validated and representative cyber threat activity.</p>
                    <p>From July 2020 to Jan 2021, I led a team of software developers building web apps for Air Force users. Over 6 months I stood up a DevOps pipeline from scratch and modernized a legacy web app using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack. I have had a passion for development since my first job after college in which I spent 2 years as a software engineer building ASP.net. I pride myself in being a self-starter, a proficient self-learner and my ability to quickly figure out challenging technology problem sets using whatever resources I can find.</p>

                    <p>I am originally from Abilene, Texas where I obtained a Bachelors Degree in Electronic Media from Abilene Christian University I enlisted in the Active Duty Air Force in 2011 as a Cryptologic Language Analyst and was assigned to the 324th, 392d, and 94th Intelligence Squadrons from 2011-2017. During this time I was selected to attend Officer Training School and received a commission as a second lieutenant from Officer Training School, Maxwell AFB, Alabama in 2018. I completed Undergraduate Cyber Training (UCT) at Keesler AFB, Mississippi before arriving at AFOTEC. I am married and have 2 children (Son - 10, Daughter - 7).</p>
                    <p>In my current job, I am a Cybersecurity Test Lead at Detachment 4, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), Peterson AFB, Colorado.  I conduct cybersecurity analysis in support of an 18 member team for the operational testing of Air Force and Space Force acquisition programs. In this role, I plan and analyze tests to measure the effects of cyber attack on weapon systems. I coordinate closely with blue and red cyber teams to create a comprehensive characterization of the cybersecurity status of a system, identify vulnerabilities, inform reconnaissance activities in support of adversarial testing, exploit system vulnerabilities, cause potential impact to mission operations, identify mitigation techniques, and evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to support its mission while withstanding validated and representative cyber threat activity.</p>
                    <p>From July 2020 to Jan 2021, I deployed to the 609 ACOMS at Shaw AFB. During this time I led a team of software developers building web apps for AFCENT users. Over 6 months I stood up a DevOps pipeline from scratch and modernized a legacy mission reporting web app using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack. I have a passion for development and the Air Force's initiative to modernize software development practices. I pride myself in being a proficient self-learner and my ability to quickly figure out challenging technology problem sets using publicly available resources.</p>
